# ebook_from_online_magazine
 I was reading  Tamil online magazine (a novel) and I was just tired of opening each chapter and reading it on my laptop, so improvised. Put together a python script to automate: to open up each chapter, extract all the text and images and write it to a docx which i later publised as kindle book (MOBI/AZW) using Calibre.

This initial commit is usecase specific with lot of stuff hardcoded.
