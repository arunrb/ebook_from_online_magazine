# ebook_from_online_magazine
A hobby project. I was reading an Tamil online magazine (a novel to be precise) and I was just tired of opening each chapter and reading it on my machine, so I wrote a script to open up each chapter, extract all the text and images and write it to a docx which i later publised as kindle book (MOBI/AZW) using Calibre.

This initial commit is highly application specific and lot of stuff is hardcoded.
